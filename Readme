📧 Automated Cold Email Agent (n8n + Google Sheets + Gmail)

This project is an end-to-end automated cold emailing system built using n8n, Google Sheets, and Gmail. It is designed to send personalized emails to multiple leads, track delivery status, and log results automatically—without manual intervention.

🚀 Overview

The workflow fetches lead data and email templates from Google Sheets, dynamically merges them, sends emails via Gmail, and logs the delivery status back into a Google Sheet. This makes it ideal for outreach campaigns, newsletters, hackathon invitations, or marketing emails.

🧠 How the Workflow Works
1. Workflow Trigger

The workflow starts when “Test workflow” is clicked in n8n.

This trigger can later be replaced with a Cron trigger for scheduled campaigns.

2. Fetch Leads from Google Sheets

Reads lead data (Name, Email, Status, Time) from Leads Sheet.

Each row represents one recipient.

3. Conditional Check (IF Node)

Ensures only eligible leads (e.g., not already contacted or unread) are processed.

Prevents duplicate or unnecessary emails.

4. Loop Over Leads

Iterates through each lead one-by-one.

Ensures controlled and sequential email sending.

5. Fetch Email Templates

Reads email templates from a separate Google Sheet.

Templates can be edited anytime without changing the workflow logic.

6. Code Node (Dynamic Content)

Formats and personalizes email content.

Can insert variables like:

Recipient name

Custom subject lines

Dynamic body text

7. Merge & Edit Fields

Combines lead data with the selected email template.

Maps fields correctly for Gmail (To, Subject, Body).

8. Send Email via Gmail

Uses Gmail API to send emails automatically.

Each email is sent individually for better tracking and reliability.

9. Wait Node

Adds a delay between emails.

Helps avoid spam detection and rate limiting.

10. Log Status in Google Sheets

Updates the status (SENT / UNREAD) and timestamp.

Creates a clear audit trail for email outreach.
